            <p>Researchers take their time when starting their own business. They want to do as much research as possible before offering a product or service. They believe that with the right preparation and information, they have a higher chance of being successful. A researcher makes sure they understand every aspect of their business and have an in-depth understanding of what they are doing. They tend to rely on facts, data and logic rather than their intuition. Detailed business plans are important to them and minimize their chances of failure.</p>
